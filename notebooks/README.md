IPython notebooks
=================

You can run the [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) server inside this folder to play with the notebooks:

    ipython notebook --pylab inline
    
will launch a browser window with the IPython Dashboard.

You can also just view the notebooks in this folder in [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) using these links:

* [Parameter objects](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tfgg/castepy/blob/new_ions/notebooks/Parameter%20objects.ipynb)
* [Simple convergence test geneation](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tfgg/castepy/blob/new_ions/notebooks/Convergence%20test.ipynb)
